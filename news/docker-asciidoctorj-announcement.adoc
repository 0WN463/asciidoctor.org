We're excited to announce the newest member of the {asciidoctor-ref}[Asciidoctor] family, {repo-ref}[Docker AsciidoctorJ]. +
{repo-ref}[Docker AsciidoctorJ] project ensure that *AsciidoctorJ* can be used by any Java application deployed into a Java Application Server (*WildFly AS* for now). +


== What is it about ?

This project provides :

* a +Dockerfile+ to build an image included WildFly 8.2 / asciidoctorj-1.5.2 / asciidoctorj-pdf-1.5.0
* *Arquillian tests* that used a docker container to convert AsciiDoc files to HTML and PDF files

The following post explains how we execute *Arquillian tests for AsciidoctorJ* into a WildFly Docker container, so we'll talk about :

* {repo-ref}[docker-asciidoctorj], the dedicated Asciidoctor github project
* {uri-asciidoctor-dockerhub}[the *official Asciidoctor organization* on Docker Hub],
* {uri-arquillian-cube-github}[Arquillian Cube], the Arquillian extension that can be used to *manage Docker containers from Arquillian*.
* {uri-jboss-wildfly-docker}[the WildFly docker image] from JBoss
