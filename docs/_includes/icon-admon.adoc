To use this feature, set the value of the +icons+ document attribute to +font+.
Asciidoctor will then emit HTML markup that selects an appropriate font character from the Font Awesome font for each admonition block.

Here's an example, starting with the AsciiDoc source:

[source]
----
= Document Title
:icons: font

NOTE: Asciidoctor supports font-based admonition icons, powered by Font Awesome!
----

the HTML it produces:

[source,html]
----
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
Asciidoctor supports font-based admonition icons, powered by Font Awesome!
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
----

This is how the admonition looks rendered:

NOTE: Asciidoctor supports font-based admonition icons, powered by Font Awesome!

Asciidoctor adds a reference to the Font Awesome stylesheet and font files served from a CDN to the document header:

[source,html]
----
<link rel="stylesheet"
  href="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/3.1.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
----

IMPORTANT: The default stylesheet (or any stylesheet produced by the {factory-ref}[Asciidoctor stylesheet factory]) is required for this feature to work.
