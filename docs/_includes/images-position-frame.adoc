It's common to frame the image in a border to further offset it from the text.
You can style any block or inline image to appear as a thumbnail using the +thumb+ role (or +th+ for short).

NOTE: The +thumb+ role doesn't alter the dimensions of the image.
For that, you need to assign the image a height and width.

Here's a common example for adding an image to a blog post.
The image floats to the right and is framed to make it stand out more from the text.

Notice we added the +related+ role to the image.
This role isn't technically required, but it gives the image semantic meaning.
