Footer docinfo files are differentiated from header docinfo files by adding +-footer+ to the file name.
In the HTML output, the footer content is inserted inside the footer div (i.e., +<div id="footer">+).
In the DocBook output, the footer content is inserted immediately before the ending +</article>+ or +</book>+ element.

.docinfo
If you want to add content to the footer of a specific document, put the content in the file +<docname>-footer.html+ (for HTML output) or +<docname>-footer.xml+ (for DocBook output), where +<docname>+ is the name of the document without the AsciiDoc extension.
Then, set the attribute +docinfo+ in the source document.

.docinfo1
If you want to add content to the footer of all documents in the same directory, put the content in the file +docinfo-footer.html+ or +docinfo-footer.xml+.
Then, set the attribute +docinfo1+ in the source document to enable the feature.

.docinfo2
If you want the document to look for either docinfo file, set the attribute +docinfo2+ in the source document.

TIP: The "Last updated" line in the footer can be disabled by unassigning the attribute +last-update-label+.
