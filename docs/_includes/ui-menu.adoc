Trying to explain to someone how to select a menu item can be a pain.
With the +menu+ macro, the symbols do the work.

For example:

----
To save the file, select menu:File[Save].

Select menu:View[Zoom > Reset] to reset the zoom level to the default setting.
----

The instructions in the example above appear as:

====
To save the file, select menu:File[Save].

Select menu:View[Zoom > Reset] to reset the zoom level to the default setting.
====
