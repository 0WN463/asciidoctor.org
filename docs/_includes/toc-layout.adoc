=== Left or right column layout
// tag::column[]
The TOC can be positioned in a column to the left or right of the document's content by assigning the +left+ or +right+ value to the +toc+ attribute.
The column is scrollable and fixed.

.Assigning the +left+ value to +toc+
----
include::toc-left.adoc[]

.Result: Assigning the +left+ value to +toc+

NOTE: Setting +:toc: left+ is equivalent to using the original AsciiDoc +toc2+ attribute.
// end::column[]

// How does the toc-position attribute fit into this section?

=== Manual placement
// tag::place[]
The +toc-placement+ attribute allows you to place the TOC anywhere in your document.
To control where the TOC is rendered in your document, unset the +toc-placement+ attribute.
Then, within the body of your document, use the +toc::[]+ block macro to indicate the TOC's location.

.Unsetting +toc-placement+ and using the +toc::[]+ macro
----
include::toc-macro.adoc[]
----
<1> The +toc+ attribute must be set in order to use +toc-placement+.
<2> +toc-placement+ is unset by placing a +!+ after its name in the document's header.
<3> In this example, the +toc::[]+ macro is placed below the first section's title, indicating that this is the location where the TOC will be displayed once the document is rendered.

.Result: Unsetting +toc-placement+ and using the +toc::[]+ macro

Asciidoctor also includes a built-in +preamble+ value.
This value places the TOC below the preamble.
You do not need to include the +toc::[]+ block macro in the document when using the +preamble+ value.

If you set +toc-placement+ but don't assign it a value, the TOC will be placed in the document's header.

CAUTION: The +toc-placement+ and +toc-position+ attributes are mutually exclusive.
