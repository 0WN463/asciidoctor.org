Asciidoctor recognizes a macro for creating keyboard shortcuts using the syntax `kbd:[key(+key)*]`.

For example:

.Common browser keyboard shortcuts
[width="50%"]
|===
|Shortcut |Purpose

|kbd:[F11]
|Toggle fullscreen

|kbd:[Ctrl+T]
|Open a new tab

|kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+N]
|New incognito window

|kbd:[Ctrl + +]
|Increase zoom
|===

You no longer have to struggle to explain to users what keys they are supposed to press.
