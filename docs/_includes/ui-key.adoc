Asciidoctor recognizes a macro for creating keyboard shortcuts using the syntax `kbd:[key(+key)*]`.

For example:

----
include::ex-ui.adoc[tags=key]
----

.Rendered common browser keyboard shortcuts
[width="50%"]
include::ex-ui.adoc[tags=key]

You no longer have to struggle to explain to users what keys they are supposed to press.
