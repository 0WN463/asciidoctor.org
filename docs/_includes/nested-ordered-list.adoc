Ordered lists
Nested

You create a nested item by using one or more dots in front of each the item:

----
. Lists
.. Outline
... Unordered
... Ordered
.. Labeled
. Titles
.. Document
.. Section
.. Block
----

[TIP]
====
Like with the asterisks in an unordered list, the number of dots in an ordered list doesn't represent the nesting level.
However, it's much more intuitive to follow this convention:

[quote]
# of dots = level of nesting

Again, we are shooting for plain text markup that is readable _as is_.
====

AsciiDoc selects a different number scheme for each level of nesting.
Here's how the previous list renders:
