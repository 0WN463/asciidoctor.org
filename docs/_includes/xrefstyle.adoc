- user-manual: Customizing the Cross Reference
////

When using one of the native converters (HTML, PDF, and EPUB3), you can customize the style of the automatic cross reference text using the `xrefstyle` document attribute.
This customization brings the cross reference text formatting from the DocBook toolchain to the native Asciidoctor converters.

By default, the cross reference uses the reftext defined on the target, which falls back to its title if the reftext is not specified.
For example, if you're refering to a section titled “Installation”, the text of the cross reference link is shown as:

....
Installation
....

If the reftext attribute is specified on the referenced element, that value is always preferred.
For example, if the section from the previous example were defined as:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[reftext="Installation Procedure"]
== Installation
----

Then the text of the cross reference link would be shown as:

....
Installation Procedure
....

Attribute references are substituted in the reftext value during parsing and reftext substitutions (specialchars, quotes, and replacements) are substituted in the value when it is used during conversion.

If the reftext is not specified, the text of the cross reference is automatically generated.
As mentioned above, the default behavior is to use the title of the reference.
There are three built-in styles you can choose from to customize the generated text of a cross reference, as controlled by the xrefstyle document attribute.

 :xrefstyle: full:: the reference signifier followed by the reference number and emphasized title (e.g., Section 2.2, “Architecture” or Figure 1, “Big Cats”).
 :xrefstyle: short:: the reference signifier followed by the reference number (e.g., Section 2.2 or Figure 1).
 :xrefstyle: basic:: the title only (Architecture or Big Cats).

This formatting only applies to references that have both a title and number (or explicit caption), but no explicit reftext.

Let's assume you want to reference a section titled “Installation” that has the number 3.2.2.
The full style is displayed as follows:

....
Section 3.2.2, “Installation”
....

The short style is displayed as follows:

....
Section 3.2.2
....

The basic style is displayed as follows:

....
Installation
....

If the reference is a chapter or an appendix, the title is always displayed in italics instead of quotes (even when the xrefstyle is basic).

You can customize the signifier that precedes the number, hinting at the reference's type (e.g., Chapter, Section, etc).
For example, to customize the word “Section”, define the `section-refsig` document attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:section-refsig: Sect.
----

If you unset the attribute, the signifier is dropped from the cross reference text.
For example, if you unset the `section-refsig` attribute in the document header:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:!section-refsig:
----

Then the full xrefstyle will display only the number and title:

....
3.2.2, “Installation”
....

Currently, only these built-in styles are supported.
Support for a custom formatting string is planned.
Refer to {issue-ref}/2212[#2212] for details.
Until then, you can implement custom formatting by provding a custom converter or overridding the xreftext method on the node.
