Included in:

- user-manual: text formatting: Custom styling with attributes
////

You can format text with CSS classes built-in to Asciidoctor, such as +big+ and +green+, or with custom styles that you define.
When text is enclosed in a set of single or double hash marks (+#+), you can prefix it with an attribute list.
The first positional attribute is treated as a role, and you can assign it a custom or built-in style value.

For instance:

[source]
----
Type the word [userinput]#asciidoctor# into the search bar.
----

When rendered to HTML, the word _asciidoctor_ is wrapped in +<span>+ tags and the role +userinput+ is used as the element's CSS class.

[source,html]
----
<span class="userinput">asciidoctor</span>
----

You can apply styles to the text using built-in CSS classes.
