- user-manual: Macro and Block Passthroughs

Passthroughs are the "anything goes" mechanism in Asciidoctor.
As its name implies, a passthrough passes its contents directly to the output document.
The contents of a passthrough are excluded from <<user-manual#text-substitutions,substitutions>>.

WARNING: Using a passthrough couples your document to a specific output format, such as HTML.
You can use conditional inclusion macros to declare passthrough markup for each of the backends you need to support.
