To include an image on its own line (i.e., a _block image_), use the +image::+ prefix in front of the file name and square brackets after it.

If you want to specify alt text, include it inside the square brackets:

You can also give the image an id, a title, set its dimensions and make it a link.

For inline images, the optional title is displayed as a tooltip.
