Asciidoctor provides several approaches for preventing substitutions.

.Backslash escaping

To prevent punctuation from being interpreted as formatting markup, proceed it with a backslash (`\`).
If the formatting punctuation begins with two characters (e.g., `+__+`), you need to proceed it with two backslashes (`+\\+`).
This is also how you can prevent character and attribute references from substitution.
When your document is processed, the backslash is removed so it doesn't display in your output.
