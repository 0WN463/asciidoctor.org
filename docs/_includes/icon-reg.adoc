Below are the possible attributes that apply in the case that font-based icons are *not* in use:

* alt - The alternate text on the `<img>` tag (HTML backend) or text for `<inlinemediaobject>` (DocBook backend)
* width - The width applied to the image
* height - The height applied to the image
* title - The title of the image displayed when the mouse hovers over it (HTML backend)
* role - The role applied to the element that surrounds the icon

Currently, the inline icon macro doesn't support any options to change it's physical position (such as alignment left or right).
