=== CSV and DSV Data Formats

Tables can be created from data stored as Comma Separated Values (CSV) and Delimiter Separated Values (DSV).
To use one of these dataset types, set the value of the `format` attribute on the table to `csv` or `dsv`, respectively.
The main difference between tables with one of these formats and `psv` tables is how the data inside the table delimiters is arranged.

When the format attribute is set to `csv`, the data separator is a comma (`,`), as seen in the table below.

When the format attribute is set to `dsv`, the data separator is a colon (`:`).

Asciidoctor also provides shorthand notation for setting CSV and DSV table formats.
The first position of the table block delimiter (i.e., `|===`) can be replaced by the data delimiter to set the table format (e.g., `,===`).

To set the format of the table to CSV using shorthand notation, simply replace the leading pipe (`|`) in the table delimiter with a command (`,`), as shown here:

include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=s-csv]

[width="90"]
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=s-csv]

In the same way, the DSV format can be specified by replacing the leading pipe (`|`) with a colon (`:`).

DSV and CSV datasets don't support formatting of individual cells.
However, you can apply formatting, such as the AsciiDoc style, to a column of cells using a table-wide column spec:

[source]
----
[cols="1h,1a"]
,===
Sky,image::sky.jpg[]
Forest,image::forest.jpg[]
,===
----

Keep in mind that endlines are not preserved in CSV and DSV data.
That does somewhat limit the type of content you can put in these cells, particularly when using the AsciiDoc cell style.

DSV and CSV datasets can be, and often are, inserted into a table using the <<user-manual#include-directive,include directive>>.
