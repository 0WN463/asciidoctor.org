To include an image on its own line (i.e., a _block image_), use the +image::+ prefix in front of the file name and square brackets after it.

[source]

image::sunset.jpg[]

====
image::sunset.jpg[]
====

If you want to specify alt text, include it inside the square brackets:

[source]
----
image::sunset.jpg[Sunset]
----

You can also give the image an id, a title, set its dimensions and make it a link.

[[img-sunset]] <1>
.A mountain sunset <2>
image::sunset.jpg[Sunset, 300, 200, link="http://www.flickr.com/photos/javh/5448336655"] <3> <4> <5>

<1> id
<2> The title of a block image is displayed underneath the image when rendered.
<3> The first positional attribute, _Sunset_, is the image's alt text.
<4> Image width and height
<5> +link=+ makes the image a link
