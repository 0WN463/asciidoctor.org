There are certain statements that you might want to draw attention to by taking them out of the flow and labeling them with a priority.
These are called admonition blocks.

Asciidoctor provides five admonition labels:

* Tip
* Note
* Important
* Warning
* Caution

Admonitions are created either by prefixing the label to a paragraph or applying the label as a style attribute to a delimited block.

.Admonition paragraph

----
NOTE: The label must be UPPERCASE.

.Admonition block

[NOTE]
==== <1>
This is an example of an admonition block.

Unlike an admonition paragraph, it may contain any AsciiDoc content.
The style can be any one of the admonition labels:

* NOTE
* TIP
* WARNING
* CAUTION
* IMPORTANT

<1> This is an example block acting as an admonition.

An admonition is rendered in a callout box with the admonition label--or its corresponding icon--in the gutter.
Icons are enabled by setting the +icons+ attribute on the document.
