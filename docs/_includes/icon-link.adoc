Like an inline image, it's possible to add additional metadata to an inline icon.

Below are the possible attributes that apply to both font-based and image-based icons:

* link - The URI target used for the icon, which will be rendered as a link
* window - The target window of the link (when the `link` attribute is specified) (HTML backend)

Here's an example of an icon rendered as a link:

[source]
----
icon:download[link="http://rubygems.org/downloads/asciidoctor-0.1.3.gem"]
----

The previous example emits the following HTML:

[source,html]
----
<a class="image" href="http://rubygems.org/downloads/asciidoctor-0.1.3.gem"><i class="icon-download"></i></a>
----
