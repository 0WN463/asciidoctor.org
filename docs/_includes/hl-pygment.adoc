////

The most popular source code highlighter in the AsciiDoc world, perhaps even the whole world, is {pygments-org}[Pygments].

In order to use Pygments with Asciidoctor, you need to install Pygments (and Python, if you don't have it yet).
You then need to install the pygments.rb RubyGem.

 $ "`\which apt-get || \which yum || \which brew`" install pygments
 $ gem install pygments.rb

To activate it in Asciidoctor, assign the value +pygments+ to the +source-highlighter+ attribute in your document's header.
