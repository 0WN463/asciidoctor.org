If you were to create a list of items in an e-mail, how would you do it?
Chances are, what you'd type is exactly how you define an outline list in AsciiDoc.

Here's an example of a grocery list written as an unordered list in AsciiDoc:

[source]
----
* Milk
* Eggs
* Bread
* Bananas
----

Was your instinct to use a hyphen instead of an asterisk?
Guess what?
That works too:

[source]
----
- Milk
- Eggs
- Bread
- Bananas
----

TIP: You are free to indent the list however it suits you.

IMPORTANT: The item's first line of text must be offset from the marker by at least one space.

What if you wanted to group the grocery list by aisle?
Then you might organize it as a nested list.
