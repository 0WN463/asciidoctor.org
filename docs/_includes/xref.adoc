In Asciidoctor, the xref inline macro is used to create cross references (i.e. links) to content, sections, and elements using an autogenerated ID, custom ID or a set anchor point.

An implicit cross reference is created by enclosing the element's ID or a location's anchor in double angled brackets.

You can also link to section headings using their titles.

Some converters, such as the HTML converter, will use the `xreflabel` as the default text of the link.
However, you can also customize this text.
After the ID, add a comma and then enter the custom text you want the cross reference to display.

You can also use the explicit xref macro to achieve the same goal.
