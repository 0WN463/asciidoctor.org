A link to another location in the current document is called a _cross reference_.
In Asciidoctor, the xref inline macro is used to create cross references in the content to sections or elements using their assigned ID. 
You create a cross reference by enclosing the element's ID in double angled brackets.

include::ex-xref.adoc[tags=base]
====

In some backends, the text of the link will be automatically generated from the title of the element.
If you want to customize the linked text, include it after the ID, separated by a comma:
