////

Monospace text formatting is often used to emulate how source code appears in computer terminals, simple text editors, and integrated development environments (IDEs).
A word or phrase is rendered using a fixed-width font, i.e. monospaced font, when it is enclosed in a single set of plus signs (+{plus}+).
A character contained within a string of characters must be enclosed in a double set of plus signs (+{plus}{plus}+).

Monospaced text can be bold and italicized, as long as the markup sets are entered in the right order.
The monospace markup must be the outermost set, then the bold set, and the italic markup must always be the innermost set.
