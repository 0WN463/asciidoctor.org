Asciidoctor supports Markdown-style blockquotes:

[source]
----
include::ex-quote.adoc[tags=md]

====
include::ex-quote.adoc[tags=md]

Like Markdown, Asciidoctor supports block content inside the blockquote, including nested blockquotes:

[source,markdown]
.Markdown-style blockquote containing block content
....
include::ex-quote.adoc[tags=md-alt]
....

Here's how this conversation renders:
