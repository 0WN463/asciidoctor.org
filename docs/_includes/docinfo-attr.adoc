To add content from a docinfo file to the header of a rendered document:

. The docinfo file must be named correctly
. The appropriate docinfo attribute must be set in the source document

How you name your docinfo file and the docinfo attribute you set in your source document depends on whether you want to add content to:

[loweralpha]
. a specific document
. all the documents in a directory
. a and b

The attributes and the corresponding file names are listed in the table below.

.Docinfo attributes and file names
|===
|Attribute |Purpose |docinfo file name for HTML |docinfo file name for DocBook

|docinfo
|Add content to a specific document
|+<docname>-docinfo.html+ 
|+<docname>-docinfo.xml+

|docinfo1
|Add content to all documents in the same directory
|+<docname>.html+ 
|+<docname>.xml+

|docinfo2
|Add content from either docinfo file
|+<docname>.html+, +<docname>-docinfo.html+  
|+<docname>.xml+, +<docname>-docinfo.xml+
|===

Let's apply the information above to an example exercise.

You have two AsciiDoc documents, +adventure.adoc+ and +insurance.adoc+, saved in the same folder.
You want to add the same content to the headers of both documents when they're rendered to HTML.

. Create a docinfo file using +<head>+ elements.
. Save the docinfo file as +docinfo.html+.
. Set the +docinfo1+ attribute in +adventure.adoc+ and +insurance.adoc+.

You also want to include some additional content to the header of +adventure.adoc+.

. Create *another* docinfo file using +<head>+ elements.
. Save the docinfo file as +adventure-docinfo.html+.
. Set the +docinfo+ attribute in +adventure.adoc+.
. Alternatively, you could remove the +docinfo1+ attribute and set +docinfo2+ instead.
