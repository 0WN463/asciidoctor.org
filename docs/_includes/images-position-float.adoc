When you start floating images, you may discover that too much content is floating around the image.
What you need is a way to clear the float.
That is provided using another role, +float-group+.

Let's assume that we've floated two images so that they are positioned next to each other and we want the next paragraph to appear below them.

[source]
----
[.left]
.Image A
image::a.png[A,240,180]

[.left]
.Image B
image::b.png[B,240,180,title="Image B"]

Text below images.
----

When this example is rendered and viewed a browser, the paragraph text appears to the right of the images.
To fix this behavior, you just need to "group" the images together in a block with self-contained floats.
Here's how it's done:

[source]
----
[.float-group]
--
[.left]
.Image A
image::a.png[A,240,180]

[.left]
.Image B
image::b.png[B,240,180]
--

Text below images.
----

This time, the text will appear below the images where we want it.
