Asciidoctor includes numerous attributes, termed “intrinsic attributes”, that automatically get assigned values when the document is converted.
The values of these intrinsic attributes are derived from how, when and where the document is processed (in other words, its runtime environment).
These attributes can be referenced anywhere in the document.
