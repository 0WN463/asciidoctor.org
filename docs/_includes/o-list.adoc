Sometimes, we need to number the items in a list.
Instinct might tell you to prefix each item with a number, like in this next list:

[source]
----
include::ex-o-list.adoc[tags=base-num]
----

Since the numbering is obvious, the AsciiDoc processor will insert the numbers for you if you omit them:

[source]
----
include::ex-o-list.adoc[tags=base]
----

====
include::ex-o-list.adoc[tags=base]
====

You can give a list a title by prefixing the line with a dot immediately followed by the text (without leaving any space after the dot).

Here's an example of a list with a title:

[source]
----
include::ex-o-list.adoc[tags=base-t]
----

====
include::ex-o-list.adoc[tags=base-t]
====
