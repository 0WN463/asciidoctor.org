A block passthrough is delimited by four plus signs (+{plus}{plus}{plus}{plus}+).
By default, a passthrough block is subject to the +attributes+ and +macros+ substitution elements.

IMPORTANT: Starting with Asciidoctor 1.5.0, no substitutions are applied to a passthrough block by default.

NOTE: More examples pending.

////

When you don't want any substituions to occur, you can apply the special +pass+ style to the passthrough block.

Need example.

You can also apply a custom set of substitutions to a passthrough block using the +subs+ attribute.

// Need example.

The block style can be used in the absence of block delimiters to promote a paragraph to a block element.
