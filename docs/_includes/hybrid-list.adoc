You can mix and match the three list types within a single hybrid list.
AsciiDoc works hard to infer the relationships between the items that are most intuitive to us humans.

Here's an example of nesting an unordered list inside of an ordered list:

----
. Linux
* Fedora
* Ubuntu
* Slackware
. BSD
* FreeBSD
* NetBSD
----

Again, you can spread the items out and indent the nested lists if that makes it more readable for you:

----
. Linux

  * Fedora
  * Ubuntu
  * Slackware

. BSD

  * FreeBSD
  * NetBSD
----

Here's a list that mixes all three types of lists:

----
Operating Systems::
  . Linux
    * Fedora
    * Ubuntu
    * Slackware
  . BSD
    * FreeBSD
    * NetBSD
Cloud Providers::
  . PaaS
    * OpenShift
    * CloudBees
  . IaaS
    * Amazon EC2
    * Rackspace
----

Here's how the list is rendered:

You can include more complex content in a list item as well.
