Asciidoctor already supports the +align+ attribute on block images to align the image within the block (e.g., left, right or center).
In this release, we added the +float+ named attribute to both the block and inline image macros.
This attribute pulls the image to one side of the page or the other and wraps block or inline content around it, respectively.

Here's an example of a floating block image.
The paragraphs or other blocks that follow the image will float up into the available space next to the image.
The image will also be positioned horizontally in the center of the image block.

Here's an example of a floating inline image.
The image will float into the upper-right corner of the paragraph text.

When you use the named attributes, CSS gets added inline (e.g., +style="float: left"+).
That's bad practice because it can make the page harder to style when you want to customize the theme.
It's far better to use CSS classes for these sorts of things, which map to roles in AsciiDoc terminology.
