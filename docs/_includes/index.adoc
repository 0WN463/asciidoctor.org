You specify index terms using one of the following syntaxes

----
=== Sir Lancelot

The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,
held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water,
signifying by divine providence that I, ((Arthur)), <1>
was to carry Excalibur (((Sword, Broadsword, Excalibur))). <2>
That is why I am your king. Shut up! Will you shut up?!
Burn her anyway! I'm not a witch.
Look, my liege! We found them.

indexterm:[Lancelot] <3>
----
<1> The double parenthesis inline macro adds a primary index term, and
includes the term in the generated output.

<2> The triple parenthesis inline macro allows for an optional second
and third index term.

<3> The full macro `indexterm:[primary, secondary, tertiary]` allow for
optional second and third index terms.

WARNING: Asciidoctor does not currently output the index when using the HTML5 backend (the same is true for AsciiDoc Python).
To output an index currently, you have to produce HTML5 (by way of DocBook) using the DocBook toolchain (`a2x` or `fopub`).
We're tracking support for native index generation when using the HTML5 backend in https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/450[issue #450].
