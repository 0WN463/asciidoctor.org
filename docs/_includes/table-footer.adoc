The last row of a table can be styled as a footer by assigning the +footer+ value to the +options+ attribute.

include::ex-base-table.adoc[tags=opt-f]

.Result: Table rendered with a footer
[width="90"]
include::ex-base-table.adoc[tags=opt-f]

TIP: Remember that when the +options+ attribute is set, and you want the first row of the table to be displayed as a header, you must assign the +header+ value.
