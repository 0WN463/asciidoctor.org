{highlightjs-org}[Highlight.js] is a popular client-side syntax highlighter that supports a broad range of {highlightjs-lang}[languages].

To use highlight.js just add `:source-highlighter: highlightjs` in your AsciiDoc file.

WARNING: Asciidoctor defaults to the basic language bundle as shipped by cdnjs (latest version).

To enable support for a wider range of languages and/or a newer version:

. create your custom bundle in the {highlightjs-lang}[download page]
. unpack the downloaded zip as a folder called `highlight` inside the folder of your AsciiDoc file
. rename `highlight.pack.js` to `highlight.min.js`
. add `:highlightjsdir: highlight` in your AsciiDoc file or call `asciidoctor -a highlightjsdir=highlight input` from the CLI
