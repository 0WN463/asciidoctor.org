{highlightjs-org}[HighlightJS] is a popular client-side syntax highlighter that supports a broad range of {highlightjs-lang}[languages].

To use highlightjs just add `:source-highlighter: highlightjs` in your AsciiDoc file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Asciidoctor defaults to the basic bundle shipped by cdnjs, v8.9.1.

To enable support for a wider range of languages and/or a newer version:

. create your custom bundle in the {highlightjs-lang}[download page]
. unpack the downloaded zip as a folder called `highlight` inside the folder of your AsciiDoc file.
. rename `highlight.pack.js` to `highlight.min.js`.
