Asciidoctor 0.1.4 offers additional bullet options for lists.
The list marker (bullet) is set using the list's block style. 

The unordered list marker can be set using any of the following block styles:

* square
* circle
* disc
* none or no-bullet (indented, but no bullet)
* unstyled (no indentation or bullet) (HTML only)

NOTE: These styles are supported by the default Asciidoctor stylesheet.

When present, the style name is assigned to the unordered list element as follows:

For HTML:: the style name is assigned to the +class+ attribute on the +<ul>+ element.
For DocBook:: the style name is assigned to the +mark+ attribute on the +<itemizedlist>+ element.

Here's an unordered list that has square bullets:

----
[square]
* one
* two
* three
----

====
[square]
* one
* two
* three
====
