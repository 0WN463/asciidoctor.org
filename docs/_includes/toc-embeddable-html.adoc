When converting AsciiDoc to embeddable HTML (i.e., the `header_footer` option is `false`), there are only two valid values for the `toc` attribute:

* preamble
* macro

IMPORTANT: The sidebar TOC (left or right) isn't available in this mode.
That's because the embeddable HTML doesn't have the outer framing necessary to support a sidebar TOC.

The <<manual-placement,macro (aka manual) placement>> requires the use of the `toc::[]` macro somewhere in the document.
The preamble placement only works if your document has a preamble (otherwise, there is no slot for it).
