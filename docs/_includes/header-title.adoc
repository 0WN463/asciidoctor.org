The document title is written as a level-0 section, which consists of a single equal sign followed by at least one space (i.e., `={sp}`) followed by the text of the title.
The document title must be the first level-0 section in the document.
The only content permitted above the document title are blank lines, comment lines and attribute entries.

Here's an example of a document title followed by an abbreviated paragraph.

.Document with a title
[source]
----
include::ex-header-title.adoc[tags=base]
----

.Result: Rendered document title
====

When `doctype` is set to `article` or `manpage`, a document can have only one level-0 section title.
The `book` document type can have multiple level-0 section titles.
The first level-0 section title, located in the header, is the document's title, and subsequent level-0 section titles are considered the part titles.

A document's title is assigned to the built-in `doctitle` attribute.
//Its value is identical to the value returned by `Document#doctitle`.
The doctitle attribute can be referenced anywhere in a document and displays the document's title when converted.

.Referencing the doctitle attribute

----
include::ex-header-title.adoc[tags=doc]

.Result: doctitle output
====

====

You can control whether or not the title is displayed when the document is rendered with the attributes `notitle` and `showtitle`.
If you don't want the title to be rendered, set the `notitle` attribute in the header or CLI.
On the other hand, the title is not displayed when a document's header and footer are disabled.
The header and footer are disabled when a document is embedded.
In this case, set the `showtitle` attribute in order to render the title.

==== Document subtitle

Asciidoctor recognizes a subtitle in the primary level-0 heading.
If the primary title contains at least one colon followed by a space (i.e, `:{sp}`), Asciidoctor treats the text after the final colon-space sequence as the subtitle.

NOTE: The subtitle is not distinguished from the main title in the `html5` output.
It's only distinguished from the main title when using the `docbook`, `epub3`, and `pdf` converters.

.Document with a subtitle
[source]
----
include::ex-header-title.adoc[tags=sub-1]
----

In this example, the following is true:

Main title:: The Dangerous and Thrilling Documentation Chronicles
Subtitle:: A Tale of Caffeine and Words

.Document with a subtitle and multiple colons
[source]
----
include::ex-header-title.adoc[tags=sub-2]
----

In this example, the following is true:

Main title:: A Cautionary Tale: The Dangerous and Thrilling Documentation Chronicles
Subtitle:: A Tale of Caffeine and Words

Instead of using a colon followed by a space as the separator characters between the main title and the subtitle, you can specify a custom separator using the `title-separator` attribute.

.Document with a subtitle using a custom separator
[source]
----
include::ex-header-title.adoc[tags=sub-2]
----

Note that a space is always appended to the value of the `title-separator` (making the default value of the `title-separator` effectively a single colon).

Asciidoctor also provides an API for extracting the title and subtitle.
See the API docs for the http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/asciidoctor/Asciidoctor/Document/Title[Document::Title] for more information.

Let's look at how to add additional metadata to the document header, including an author and her email address.
