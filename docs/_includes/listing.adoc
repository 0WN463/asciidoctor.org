You've already seen many examples of the listing block (i.e., code block), which is surrounded by lines with four hyphens.
Since a listing block is typically used for source code, substitutions are not desirable, therefore only special characters and callouts are replaced in the text.

* the phrase ``listing block'' is not italicized, despite having underscores around it.
