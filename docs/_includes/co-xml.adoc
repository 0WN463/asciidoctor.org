XML doesn't have line comments, so our "tuck the callout behind a line comment" trick doesn't work here.
To use callouts in XML, you must place the callout's angled brackets around the the XML comment and callout number.

Here's how it appears in a listing:

[source]
....
[source,xml]
----
<section>
  <title>Section Title</title>  \<!--1-->
</section>
----
<1> The section title is required.
....

Here's how it looks when rendered:

[source,xml]
----
<section>
  <title>Section Title</title>  <!--1-->
</section>
----
<1> The section title is required.

Notice the comment is gone.
Now both you and the reader can copy and paste XML source code containing callouts without worrying about errors.
