Included in:

- user-manual: text formatting: Custom styling with attributes
////

Any quoted text can be prefixed with an attribute list.
The first positional attribute is treated as a role.
The role can be used to apply custom styling to the text.
For instance:

[source]
----
Type the word [userinput]#asciidoc# into the search bar.
----

When rendering to HTML, the word ``asciidoc'' is wrapped in +<span>+ tags and the role is used as the element's CSS class:

[source,html]
----
<span class="userinput">asciidoc</span>
----

You can apply styles to the text using CSS.

[role="unstyled"]
$$#Open style#$$:: One hash (+#+) on either side of a word or phrase makes it possible to assign it a role (i.e., CSS class).

[source]
----
[small]#phrase styled by CSS class .small#

[big]##O##nce upon a time...
