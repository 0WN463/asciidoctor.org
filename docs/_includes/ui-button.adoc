It can be equally difficult to communicate to the reader that they need to press a button.
They can't tell if you are saying ``OK'' or they are supposed to look for a button labeled "OK".
It's all about getting the semantics right.
The +btn+ macro to the rescue!

For example:

----
include::ex-ui.adoc[tags=button]
----

Here's the result:

====
include::ex-ui.adoc[tags=button]
====
