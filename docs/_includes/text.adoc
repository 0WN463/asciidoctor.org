Just as we emphasize certain words and phrases when we speak, we can emphasize them in text by surrounding them with punctuation.
AsciiDoc refers to this markup as _quoted text_.

CAUTION: You may not always want these symbols to indicate text formatting.
In those cases, you'll need to use markup to <<user-manual#preventing-substitutions,escape the text>>.
