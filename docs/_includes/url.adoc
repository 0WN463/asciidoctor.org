A Uniform Resource Link (URL) represents the location of a resource on the web.
Typical URLs contain a scheme, domain name, file name, and extension.

Asciidoctor recognizes the following common schemes without the help of any markup.

[[schemes]]
* http
* https
* ftp
* irc
* mailto
* email\@email.com

Since the URL in the example below begins with +http+, Asciidoctor will automatically turn it into a hyperlink when it is processed.

----
The homepage for the Asciidoctor Project is http://www.asciidoctor.org. <1>
----
<1> The trailing period will not get caught up in the link.

To attach a URL to text, enclose the text in square brackets at the end of the URL.

When a URL does not start with one of the <<schemes,common schemes>>, you must use the +link+ macro.
The URL is preceeded by +link:+ and followed by square brackets.
The square brackets can include optional link text, target preference, and roles.

.Anatomy of a +link+ macro

First, let's look at an example of a +link+ macro that contains link text.

.Troubleshooting URLs
****
A URL may not render correctly when it contains characters such as underscores (+_+) or carets (+{caret}+).

Next, we'll add a target and role to a link +macro+.
When you set attributes in the +link+ macro, you must also set the +linkattrs+ attribute in the document's header because Asciidoctor does not parse attributes in the link macro by default.
Once you've set +linkattrs+ in the header, you can then specify the name of the target window using the +window+ attribute.

Since +_blank+ is the most common window name, we've introduced shorthand for it.
Just end the link text with a caret (+^+):

CAUTION: If you use the caret syntax more than once in a single paragraph, you may need to escape the first occurrence with a backslash.

When +linkattrs+ is set, you can add a role (i.e., CSS class) to the link.

TIP: Links with attributes (including the subject and body segments on mailto links) are a feature unique to Asciidoctor.
When they are enabled, you must surround the link text in double quotes if it contains a comma.
