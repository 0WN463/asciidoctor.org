Images are a great way to enhance the text, whether its to illustrate an idea, show rather than tell or just help the reader connect with the text.

Out of the box, images and text behave like oil and water.
Images don't like to share space with text.
They are kind of "pushy" about it.
That's why we focused on tuning the controls in the image macros so you can get the images and the text to flow together.

There are two approaches you can take when positioning your images:

. Named attributes
. Roles
