== Include Directive

This content is included in the user manual
////

The +include+ directive allows you to insert the content of a file directly into another file. 
The include directive resolves files relative to the current document instead of the root document.
This applies to include directives used inside a file which itself has been included.

Asciidoctor does not insert blank lines between adjacent include statements to keep the content separated. 
Be sure to add a blank line in the source document to avoid unexpected results, such as a section title being swallowed.
Also, the relative indentation between the lines of source code *is not affected* unless you set the <<normalizing-the-block-indentation,+indent+ attribute>>.
