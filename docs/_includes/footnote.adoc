A footnote is created with the footnote macro (`+footnote:[]+`).
//If you plan to reference a footnote more than once, use the ID footnoteref macro (`+footnoteref:[]+`).

.Footnote macro syntax
[source]
----
include::ex-footnote.adoc[tag=base-c]
----
<1> Insert the footnote macro directly after any punctuation. The footnote macro only uses one colon.
<2> The first time you enter a footnote you want to reuse, give it a unique ID directly after the `:`.
<3> Insert the footnote's content within the square brackets of the macro. The text may span several lines.
<4> The next time you reference the footnote you only need to insert the ID, followed by an empty set of square brackets.

The footnotes will be numbered consecutively throughout the document.
