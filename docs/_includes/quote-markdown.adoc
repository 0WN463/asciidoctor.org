Asciidoctor supports Markdown-style blockquotes:

[source]
----
> I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing,
> and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical.
> -- Thomas Jefferson, Papers of Thomas Jefferson: Volume 11
----

This markup renders the same as the example above.

Like Markdown, Asciidoctor supports block content inside the blockquote, including nested blockquotes:

[source,markdown]
.Markdown-style blockquote containing block content
....
> > What's new?
>
> I've got Markdown in my AsciiDoc!
>
> > Like what?
>
> * Blockquotes
> * Headings
> * Fenced code blocks
>
> > Is there more?
>
> Yep. AsciiDoc and Markdown share a lot of common syntax already.
....

Here's how this conversation renders:

> > What's new?
>
> I've got Markdown in my AsciiDoc!
>
> > Like what?
>
> * Blockquotes
> * Headings
> * Fenced code blocks
>
> > Is there more?
>
> Yep. AsciiDoc and Markdown share a lot of common syntax already. Just try it.
