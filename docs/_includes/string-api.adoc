Render strings using the API

To render an AsciiDoc-formatted string:

[source,ruby]
----
 puts Asciidoctor.render '*This* is Asciidoctor.'
----

When rendering a string, the header and footer are excluded by default to make Asciidoctor consistent with other lightweight markup engines like Markdown. 
If you want the header and footer, just enable it using the +:header_footer+ option:

[source,ruby]
----
 puts Asciidoctor.render '*This* is Asciidoctor.', :header_footer => true
----

Now you'll get a full HTML 5 file. 
If you only want the inline markup to be processed, set the +:doctype+ option to +'inline'+:

[source,ruby]
----
 puts Asciidoctor.render '*This* is Asciidoctor.', :doctype => 'inline'
----

As before, you can also produce DocBook 4.5:

[source,ruby]
----
 puts Asciidoctor.render '*This* is Asciidoctor.', :header_footer => true,
   :backend => 'docbook'
----

If you don't like the output you see, you can change it. 
Any of it!
