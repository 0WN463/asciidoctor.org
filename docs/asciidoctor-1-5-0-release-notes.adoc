== Get technical with MathJax

If you need to get technical in your writing, Asciidoctor integrates with {uri-mathjax}[MathJax] and allows you to write {uri-latexmath}[TeX / LaTeX] or {uri-asciimath}[AsciiMath] expressions.

.A rendered LaTeXMath equation
[latexmath]
++++
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}
++++

With the introduction of the {uri-stem}[STEM attribute], you can now create {uri-stem-in}[inline] and {uri-stem-bl}[block] formulas.

////
MathJax is the standard library for displaying Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) expressions in the browser.

First, enable STEM support by defining the `stem` attribute, optionally overriding the default STEM dialect of `asciimath`:

 :stem: latexmath

Then, write {uri-latexmath}[TeX / LaTeX] or {uri-asciimath}[AsciiMath] expressions inside a block:

----
[stem]
++++
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}
++++
----

or an inline macro:

----
:stem: asciimath

The earth's surface is mostly covered in stem:[H_2O].
Respect it!
----

The result is rendered beautifully in the browser thanks to MathJax!

[latexmath]
++++
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}
++++

TIP: You don't need to add special delimiters around the expression as the MathJax documentation suggests.
Asciidoctor handles that for you automatically!

== Diagrams, diagrams, diagrams

You can add even more visual elements to your document with diagrams conjured from plain text.
{uri-asciidoctor-diagram}[Asciidoctor Diagram] emerged from the request to port the PlantUML extension for AsciiDoc Python to Asciidoctor.
Pepijn Van Eeckhoudt (@pepijnve) took the reins and created a comprehensive diagram extension that not only adds integration with PlantUML, but three additional diagramming tools, as well as a framework for adding more in the future.

Asciidoctor 1.5.0 supports the following diagramming tools.

* {uri-plantuml}[PlantUML]
* {uri-graphviz}[Graphviz]
* {uri-ditaa}[Ditaa]
* {uri-shaape}[Shaape]

Read on to learn how to load extensions like Asciidoctor Diagram from the CLI.

== Load extensions from the CLI

Asciidoctor introduced an extensions API in 0.1.4 that allows you to extend the AsciiDoc syntax and tap into the lifecycle of the processor.
However, it was only possible to load these extensions when invoking Asciidoctor via the API or by creating a custom launch script.

The `asciidoctor` command now supports the `-r` and `-I` flags from the `ruby` command to require additional paths or modify the load path, respectively.

icon:gears[4x]

Here's an example of how to use the `-r` flag to enable the Asciidoctor Diagram extension:

 $ asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-diagram sample.adoc

You can also pass an absolute or relative path to the `-r` flag and you can use the flag multiple times.

 $ asciidoctor -r ./my-extension-a.rb -r ./my-extension-b.rb sample.adoc

The scripts are loaded before any processing occurs and in the order they are listed.

== Consistent quotes

The single quote (`'`) and the backtick (`{backtick}`) are the two markup characters in the AsciiDoc syntax that often give people trouble.
They like to get in each other's way.
We decided to shuffle around some of the AsciiDoc syntax to address this problem and, in general, make it more consistent and easy to learn.
Not only do these changes reduce slipups in the parser, it also strengthens the meaning of the plus character and brings more alignment with Markdown by making backtick (`{backtick}`) the primary character for monospace.

=== Compat mode for old-schoolers

Before introducing what has changed, we want to highlight that you can forgo the changes to the syntax by setting the new `compat-mode` attribute, shown here defined in the document header:

 :compat-mode:

Compat mode is used to enable traditional syntax when the new syntax deviates from it.

=== Use “+” for “passthrough”

The `{plus}` character in the traditional AsciiDoc syntax is not used consistently.
Single plus (`{plus}`) and double plus (`{plus-x2}`) are used to format text as monospace, whereas triple plus (`{plus-x3}`) and quadruple plus (`{plus-x4}`) are used to escape text from processing.

We can make the AsciiDoc syntax easier to learn and remember by always using `{plus}` as a passthrough formatting mark.
Instead of using the single plus and double plus for monospaced formatting, we've made them constrained and unconstrained literals (i.e., “render it as it looks”), respectively.
For example:

 +_bar_+ becomes _bar_
 foo++_bar_++ becomes foo_bar_

NOTE: You might notice that double plus ({plus-x2}) is effectively the same as double dollar ({dollar-x2}).
The latter should be viewed as deprecated.

We haven't yet mentioned how to format text as monospace.
For that, we'll put the backtick back into play.

=== Markdown-style monospace

Authors who are familiar with Markdown are accustomed to using the backtick ({backtick}) to format text as monospace.
We've embraced that convention in Asciidoctor.

The backtick characters around text only means the text should be formatted as monospace.
The backtick characters _do not_ add passthrough semantics.
In most cases, the passthrough semantics aren't necessary, so using the backticks for monospaced formatting is all that's necessary.

 `literal` becomes literal (in monospace)
 `{backend}` becomes html5 (in monospace)
 a``||``b becomes a||b (where || is monospace)

If you want to prevent substitutions in the monospaced text, you can either escape the special punctuation:

 `\{backend}` becomes {backend} (in monospace)

or you can surround the text inside the backticks in pluses (remember, “plus for passthrough”):

 `+{backend}+` becomes {backend} (in monospace)

By not mixing monospace formatting with passthrough (literal) semantics, we are deviating slightly from the behavior of backticks in Markdown.
However, that's because AsciiDoc has additional features, such as attribute references, that we want to be able to leverage when formatting text as monospace.

There will be a period of time during which you'll have to process your document with both Asciidoctor 0.1.4 and 1.5.0 (mostly while we wait on GitHub to upgrade).
We've added special logic in the processor to handle a hybrid syntax to use in the interim.
Please refer to the link:/docs/migration[migration guide] for details.

=== Smarter “smart” quotes

The backtick character is also used for making curved quotes in the AsciiDoc syntax.
Because the syntax is so similar to that of monospaced literal text, it often matches in unexpected ways.
We've made the smart quotes syntax...smarter.

icon:quote-left[4x]

We use the backtick as a modifier on a quote to indicate it should be curved (i.e., a smart quote).
You now place the backtick inside the quote character, adjacent to the quoted phrase.

 Dig through a copy of '`The Times`' and you're bound to see a lot of "`smart`" quotes.

This change brings the backtick closer to the quote and makes parsing more deterministic since it no longer gets confused with other uses of the backtick.

You can also use this syntax to force the use of single curved quotes anywhere in normal text.

 The `'50s and `'60s are referred to as the "`golden age`" of America.

== Open Source fonts

The culture of Asciidoctor is deeply rooted in Open Source.
That means Asciidoctor should use Open Source all the way down, including the fonts in the default stylesheet.

icon:font[4x]

In the past, the default stylesheet has relied on Microsoft Core Fonts (Arial & Georgia) installed on the user's system.
We've replaced these proprietary fonts with Open Source fonts, which we now load from Google Fonts.

Here's a list of the fonts we've selected:

* Body font - Noto Serif
* Heading font - Open Sans Light
* Monospaced font - Droid Sans

I particularly like Noto Serif because it's an extremely readable font that also happens to support the world's languages.

We also made some additional refinements to the default stylesheet that give it a professional, modern appearance.
Here's a preview of the new default theme:

image::screenshot-default-theme.png[Screenshot of default Asciidoctor theme]

== Font Awesome 4.1

Speaking of fonts, Asciidoctor now integrates with Font Awesome 4.1, thanks to the work done by Guillaume Grossetie (@mogztter)!
You now have *over 400 icons* to use to decorate your document!

icon:flag[4x]

“Everything is AWESOME!”

== Level your offsets

The `leveloffset` attribute is used to shift the level of sections when combining documents.
It works great for a single include level, but as Groovy developers Cedric and Guillaume discovered, it quickly breaks down when you get into multiple levels of nesting.

icon:indent[4x]

The problem is that the level offset value is assumed to be absolute.
Asciidoctor now supports _relative_ level offset values using a leading + or - operator.

 :leveloffset: +1
 include::chapter-01.adoc[]
 :leveloffset: 0

Alternatively, you can specify the `leveloffset` attribute directly on the include directive so you don't have to worry about restoring the old value.

 include::chapter-01.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Filtering tag directives

The Groovy developers have also been making heavy usage of partial file includes using lines selected by the tag directive.
They discovered that tag directives that appear within a broader tagged ranges get carried over into the document.
These extra tag directives are now filtered out so you can {uri-tag}[nest fine-grained ranges inside broader ranges].

icon:filter[4x]

////
For example, if our include file has the following content:

----
tag::all-snippets[]
tag::snippet-a[]
snippet a
end::snippet-a[]

tag::snippet-b[]
snippet b
end::snippet-b[]
end::all-snippets[]
----

And we include this file using the following include directive:

 include::file-with-snippets.adoc[tag=all-snippets]

Only the following lines will be selected:

....
snippet a

snippet b
....
////

The tag directives are also searched using a more strict match to avoid false matches.

== Embracing DocBook 5

icon:book[4x]

The {uri-docbook5}[DocBook 5 specification] was finalized in 2008.
It's time we embrace it.
DocBook 5 is now the default output for the {uri-docbook}[`docbook` converter].
If you still need to produce DocBook 4.5, set the backend to `docbook45`.

== XHTML makes happy XML parsers

HTML5 reintroduced flexible HTML syntax that is only loosely based on SGML and most certainly not XML.
This decision makes HTML5 more approachable.
However, it makes XML parsers sad (read as: choke).

To accomodate tools that rely on XML parsers to read the generated HTML, Asciidoctor now supports the XHTML variant of HTML5, known as XHTML5.

icon:code[4x]

To output XHTML5 instead of HTML5, simply set the backend to `xhtml` or, to be explicit, `xhtml5`.
The “x” at the beginning of the name tells Asciidoctor to add the xmlns attribute to the root, close short tags and assign values to boolean attributes.
Your XML parser will thank you.

== Asciidoctor.js is Asciidoctor

[%hardbreaks]
Asciidoctor in JavaScript.
It was a dream.
Then it was a prototype.
Now, it's the real deal.

Guillaume Grossetie (@mogztter) led the effort during the 1.5.0 development cycle to align the {uri-asciidoctorjs}[Asciidoctor.js] code base with Asciidoctor core.
After _a lot_ of fiddling and Opal patches, we managed to get Asciidoctor.js building directly against master and the Asciidoctor 1.5.0 release.
That means that for the first time, Asciidoctor.js *is* Asciidoctor.

Anthonny Quérouil (@anthonny) then developed a Grunt build script to bundle Asciidoctor.js and publish it to npm (the Node.js package manager) and Bower (the web package manager).

Guillaume is the creator of the {uri-chrome-extension}[AsciiDoc preview for Chrome] and Anthonny the creator of the {uri-atom-plugin}[AsciiDoc preview for Atom].
Thomas Kern (@nerk) was quick to follow up with an {uri-brackets-extension}[AsciiDoc preview for Brackets].
Guillaume, Anthonny and Thomas have been collaborating on tooling based on Asciidoctor.js.
They're helping Asciidoctor boldly go where no AsciiDoc implementation has gone before.

The alignment of Asciidoctor.js with Asciidoctor core was a major effort.
I want to sincerely thank Guillaume, Anthonny and the Opal team (Adam Beynon, meh and Elia Schito) for making this happen.

== Refined substitutions

When you needed to customize the substitutions on a block, you used to have to list out all the substitutions you wanted to enable.
It's now possible to add or remove substitutions to the default substitution set using the `+` and `-` modifiers.
We've also abreviated the `substitutions` attribute to `subs` and `specialcharacters` to `specialchars`.

Additionally, when defining substitutions on the inline pass macro, you only have to type the first letter of the substitution group name.

 pass:q[_Save As..._]

These changes should save a lot of unnecessary typing!

== Secure assets

Serving assets over SSL is a best practice to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks and preying eyes in general.

icon:lock[4x]

All remote assets used out of the box in Asciidoctor, such as Font Awesome, are now served over SSL from cdnjs.cloudflare.com and fonts.googleapis.com.

== Print your docs

Leif Gruenwoldt (@leif81) pointed out that the print styles were too aggressive, causing the printed document to lose its integrity.
We worked together to tweak the stylesheet until the output looked about as good as a PDF generated by the DocBook toolchain.
The styles even separate chapters into different pages when the doctype is book.
We also added table border styles for all the permutations of grid and frame.

icon:print[4x]

Who needs DocBook when you've got HTML5 and CSS3?

== Hide the URI schemes

Asciidoctor auto-detects and auto-links URLs.
Writers often don't take advantage of this feature because it shows the URI scheme prefix (e.g., pass:[http://]).
They opt instead for the long form for the sole purpose of hiding the scheme.

 http://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor.org]

Asciidoctor can now produce the same result if you set the `hide-uri-scheme` attribute on the document:

----
:hide-uri-scheme:

http://asciidoctor.org
----

== Human-friendly cross references

If you are linking to an anchor point somewhere else in your document, you can refer to it by title instead of by ID.
For example:

----
Refer to <<Section A>>.

== Section A
----

You'll likely want to switch to using IDs as the document matures, but this should certainly help with flow in early drafts!

== PDF and EPUB3

Asciidoctor can now convert directly from AsciiDoc to PDF and EPUB3, using {uri-asciidoctor-pdf}[Asciidoctor PDF] and {uri-asciidoctor-epub3}[Asciidoctor EPUB3], respectively.
These converters are hosted in their own repositories and are distributed as separate gems.

TODO include EPUB3 screenshot

The converters are currently alpha, but still very functional.
