Syntax to cover:
- preface
- index terms
- built-in attributes (such as {author}, {revision}, etc)
- start=n for ordered lists
- horizontal labeled list
- anchor for any block element
- block metadata (missing example of normal attributes)
- command line reference? perhaps another doc? yes

PDF TODO:
- add license on title page (legalnotice tag)
- table cell bg
- show example of section levels
- syntax highlight ruby code (requires switch to https://code.google.com/p/java-syntax-highlighter)
- style sidebar block

== About
endif::basebackend-docbook[]

AsciiDoc is a mature, lightweight markup language for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, web pages, slide decks and man pages in plain text.
{description}

[NOTE]
====
Several examples focus on the output generated by the HTML backend.
AsciiDoc produces complementary output when generating DocBook.

Most features labeled ``Asciidoctor only'' can be made available to the native AsciiDoc processor by using https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/blob/master/compat/asciidoc.conf[this AsciiDoc configuration file] from the Asciidoctor project.

== Document Header

IMPORTANT: A header is optional.
When you do add a header to your document, the only required element is a title.

CAUTION: The header may not contain blank lines and must be offset from the content by at least one blank line.

.Title only
----
include::{includedir}/ex-header-title.adoc[tags=b-base]
----

.Title and author line
----
include::{includedir}/ex-author.adoc[tags=b-base]
----

.Title, author line and revision line
----
include::{includedir}/ex-rev.adoc[tags=b-base]
----

IMPORTANT: You cannot have a revision line without an author line.

.Document header with attributes
----
include::{includedir}/ex-header-attr.adoc[tags=b-base]
----

[[section-titles]]
== Section Titles (Headers)

.Article doctype
----
include::{includedir}/ex-section.adoc[tags=base]
----

[.result]
====
// float is required to create plain headers
include::{includedir}/ex-section.adoc[tags=b-base]
====

WARNING: When using the article doctype (the default), you can only have one level-0 section title (i.e., the document title) and it must be in the document header.

NOTE: The number of equal signs matches the heading level in the HTML output.
For example, _Section Level 1_ becomes an +<h2>+ heading.

.Book doctype
----
include::{includedir}/ex-section.adoc[tags=book]
----

[.result]
====
// float is required to create plain headers
include::{includedir}/ex-section.adoc[tags=b-book]
====

////
IMPORTANT: There are two other ways to define a section title.
_Their omission is intentional_.
They both require more markup and are therefore unnecessary.
The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setext[setext] title syntax (underlined text) is especially wasteful, hard to remember, hard to maintain and error prone.
The reader never sees the extra markup, so why type it?
*Be frugal!*

.Explicit id
----
[[primitives-nulls]]
== Primitive types and null values

.Section anchors and links (Asciidoctor only)

+sectanchors+::
When this document attribute is set, a section icon anchor appears in front of the section title.

+sectlinks+::
When this document attribute is set, the section titles become links.

NOTE: Section title anchors depend on the default Asciidoctor stylesheet to render properly.

== Include Files

.Document parts
----
include::{includedir}/ex-include.adoc[tags=base]
----

CAUTION: Asciidoctor does not insert blank lines between adjacent include statements to keep the content separated.
Be sure to add a blank line in the source document to avoid unexpected results, such as a section title being swallowed.

.Include content from a URI
----
include::{includedir}/ex-include.adoc[tags=uri]
----

NOTE: Including content from a URI is potentially dangerous, so it's disabled if the safe mode is SECURE or greater.
Assuming the safe mode is less than SECURE, you must also set the +allow-uri-read+ attribute to permit Asciidoctor to read content from a URI.

== Horizontal Rules and Page Breaks

.Horizontal rule

== Lists

.Unordered, basic
----
include::{includedir}/ex-u-list.adoc[tags=base]
----

[.result]
====
include::{includedir}/ex-u-list.adoc[tags=base]
====

NOTE: Blank lines are required before and after a list.

TIP: You can force two lists apart with a line comment, as the previous example demonstrates.
The text in the comment, (`^`), is optional, but serves as a hint to other authors that this line serves as an "end of list" marker.

.Unordered, max nesting
----
include::{includedir}/ex-u-list.adoc[tags=max]
----

[.result]
====
include::{includedir}/ex-u-list.adoc[tags=max]
====

TIP: The unordered list marker can be changed using {list-marker}[block styles].

.Checklist
----
include::{includedir}/ex-u-list.adoc[tags=check]
----

[.result]
====
include::{includedir}/ex-u-list.adoc[tags=check]
====

TIP: Checklists can use {checklist-ref}[font-based icons and be interactive].

.Ordered, basic
----

[.result]

TIP: For ordered lists, Asciidoctor supports {list-number}[numeration styles] such as +lowergreek+ and +decimal-leading-zero+.

.Labeled, single-line
----
include::{includedir}/ex-l-list.adoc[tags=b-base]

[.result]
====
include::{includedir}/ex-url.adoc[tags=b-linkattrs]
====

NOTE: Links with attributes (including the subject and body segments on mailto links) are a feature unique to Asciidoctor.
To enable them, you must set the +linkattrs+ attribute on the document.
When they are enabled, you must quote the link text if it contains a comma.

image::http://asciidoctor.org/images/octocat.jpg[GitHub mascot]
====

IMPORTANT: Images are resolved relative to the value of the {imagesdir-ref}[+imagesdir+ document attribute], which defaults to an empty value.
The +imagesdir+ attribute can be an absolute path, relative path or base URL.
If the image target is a URL or absolute path, the +imagesdir+ prefix is _not_ added.

TIP: You should use the +imagesdir+ attribute to avoid hard coding the shared path to your images in every image macro.

.Image macro using positioning role

TIP: There are a variety of attributes available to {image-attributes}[position and frame images].

:data-uri:
----

NOTE: When the +data-uri+ attribute is set, all images in the document--including admonition icons--are embedded into the document as https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/data_URIs[data URIs].

TIP: Instead of declaring the +data-uri+ attribute in the document, you can pass it as a command-line argument using +-a data-uri+.

== Videos

NOTE: Any block can have a title, positioned above the block.
A block title is a line of text that starts with a dot.

.Admonition and callout icons
====
Asciidoctor can "draw" icons using {fontawesome-ref}[Font Awesome^] and CSS.

To use this feature, set the value of the +icons+ document attribute to +font+.
Asciidoctor will then emit HTML markup that selects an appropriate font character from the Font Awesome font for each admonition block.

Icons can also be used {icon-inline}[inline] and {icon-attribute}[styled].

.Air quotes (Asciidoctor only)

As a tip of the hat to Dick, Asciidoctor recognizes text between "air quotes" as a quote block.
Air quotes are the best thing since fenced code blocks.

* To specify multiple roles using the shorthand syntax, separate them by dots.
* The order of +id+ and +role+ values in the shorthand syntax does not matter.

== Comments

.Line
----
// A single-line comment.

TIP: Single-line comments can be used to divide elements, such as two adjacent lists.

.Block
----
////
A multi-line comment.

Notice it's a delimited block.

== Tables

.Table with a title, three columns, a header, and two rows of content
----
include::{includedir}/ex-table.adoc[tags=b-base-h-co]
----
<1> Unless the +cols+ attribute is specified, the number of columns is equal to the number of vertical bars on the first non-blank line inside the block delimiters.
<2> When a blank line follows a single line of column titles, the column titles row will be styled as a header row by default.

[.result]
====
include::{includedir}/ex-table.adoc[tags=b-base-h]
====

.Table with two columns, a header, and two rows of content
----
include::{includedir}/ex-table.adoc[tags=b-col-h-co]
----
<1> The +*+ in the +cols+ attribute is the repeat operator. It means repeat the column specification for the remainder of columns. In this case, it means to repeat the default formatting across 4 columns. When the header row is not defined on a single line, you must use the +cols+ attribute to set the number of columns and +options+ attributes to make the first row a header.

[.result]
====
include::{includedir}/ex-table.adoc[tags=b-col-h]
====

.Table with three columns, a header, and two rows of content
----
include::{includedir}/ex-table.adoc[tags=b-col-indv-co]
----
<1> In this example, the +cols+ attribute has two functions. It specifies that this table has three columns, and it sets their relative widths.
