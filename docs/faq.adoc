== FAQs

=== Does Asciidoctor only process text that is US-ASCII encoded?

No.
Asciidoctor has full Unicode support (UTF-8 by default, UTF-16 with a BOM).
ðŸ‘Œ

The "`Ascii`" in AsciiDoc and Asciidoctor merely refers to the range of characters from which the special characters in the syntax (section title markers, block delimiters, macro and block names, etc.) are drawn.
In other words, you only need to use characters from US-ASCII to form the structure of an AsciiDoc document.
The content itself, which includes attribute values, may contain characters from any character plane in Unicode.

Asciidoctor assumes input is encoded in UTF-8 and it encodes output documents in UTF-8 as well.

=== How do I make relative links to other AsciiDoc files to work correctly on GitHub?

include::{includedir}/xref-source-to-source.adoc[]

=== What is the media type for AsciiDoc?

A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type[media type], or MIME type, is a code for identifying file formats and format contents transmitted on the Internet.

The first idea for an official MIME type for AsciiDoc came from the http://discuss.asciidoctor.org/Mimetype-for-Asciidoc-td211.html[Mimetype for AsciiDoc] discussion on the Asciidoctor mailinglist:

 text/x-asciidoc

Recently, the internet media type `text/markdown` was registered for Markdown, so a stronger case can now be made for:

 text/asciidoc

Either one will do, though it probably makes sense to align with Markdown on this one.

== Troubleshooting

=== Part way through the document, the blocks stop rendering correctly. What went wrong?

include::{includedir}/ts-block-render.adoc[tag=answer]

=== Why don't links to URLs that contain an underscore or caret work?

include::{includedir}/ts-url-format.adoc[tag=sb]
