== FAQs

=== Does Asciidoctor only process text that is US-ASCII encoded?

No.
Asciidoctor has full support for Unicode.
ðŸ‘Œ

Asciidoctor assumes input is encoded in UTF-8 and it encodes output documents in UTF-8 as well.

=== How do I make relative links to other AsciiDoc files to work correctly on GitHub?

include::{includedir}/xref-source-to-source.adoc[]

=== What is the media type for AsciiDoc?

A http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type[media type], or MIME type, is a code for identifying file formats and format contents transmitted on the Internet.

The first idea for an official MIME type for AsciiDoc came from the http://discuss.asciidoctor.org/Mimetype-for-Asciidoc-td211.html[Mimetype for AsciiDoc] discussion on the Asciidoctor mailinglist:

 text/x-asciidoc

Recently, the internet media type `text/markdown` was registered for Markdown, so a stronger case can now be made for:

 text/asciidoc

Either one will do, though it probably makes sense to align with Markdown on this one.

== Troubleshooting

=== Part way through the document, the blocks stop rendering correctly. What went wrong?

include::{includedir}/ts-block-render.adoc[tag=answer]

=== Why don't links to URLs that contain an underscore or caret work?

include::{includedir}/ts-url-format.adoc[tag=sb]
