{uri-project}[Asciidoctor] is a _fast_ text processor and publishing toolchain for converting {uri-what-is-asciidoc}[AsciiDoc] content to HTML5, DocBook 5 (or 4.5) and other formats.
Asciidoctor is written in {uri-ruby}[Ruby], packaged as a RubyGem and published to {uri-rubygem}[RubyGems.org].
The gem is also included in several Linux distributions, including Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu.
Asciidoctor is open source, {uri-repo}[hosted on GitHub] and released under the MIT license.

[TIP]
====
You can run Asciidoctor on the JVM using JRuby.
To invoke the Asciidoctor API directly from Java and other JVM languages, use {uri-asciidoctorj}[AsciidoctorJ].
There are plugins available, based on AsciidoctorJ, that integrate the Asciidoctor processor into Apache Maven, Grade or Javadoc builds.

Asciidoctor also runs in JavaScript.
We use http://opalrb.org[Opal] to transcompile the Ruby source to JavaScript to produce {uri-asciidoctorjs}[Asciidoctor.js], a fully-functional version of Asciidoctor that works in any JavaScript environment, such as a web browser or Node.js.
Asciidoctor.js is used to power the AsciiDoc preview extensions for Chrome, Atom, Brackets and other web-based tooling.

== AsciiDoc Processing

Asciidoctor reads and parses text written in the AsciiDoc syntax, then feeds the parse tree into a set of built-in templates to produce HTML5, DocBook 5 (or 4.5).
You have the option of writing your own converter or providing {uri-tilt}[Tilt]-supported templates to customize the generated output or produce alternative formats.

NOTE: Asciidoctor is a drop-in replacement for the original AsciiDoc Python processor (`asciidoc.py`).
The Asciidoctor test suite has {uri-tests}[> 1,500 tests] to ensure compatibility with the AsciiDoc syntax.

In addition to the standard AsciiDoc syntax, Asciidoctor recognizes additional markup and formatting options, such as font-based icons (e.g., [x-]`icon:fire[]`) and UI elements (e.g., [x-]`button:[Save]`).
Asciidoctor also offers a modern, responsive theme based on {uri-foundation}[Foundation] to style the HTML5 output.

== Requirements

Asciidoctor works on Linux, OSX (Mac) and Windows and requires one of the following implementations of {uri-ruby}[Ruby]:

* MRI (Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.3, 2.0.0 & 2.1.2)
* JRuby 1.7 (Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 modes)
* Rubinius 2.2.x
* Opal (JavaScript)

We welcome your help testing Asciidoctor on these and other platforms.
Refer to <<{idprefix}contributing,Contributing>> to learn how to get involved.

== Installation

Asciidoctor can be installed using (a) the `gem install` command, (b) Bundler or (c) package managers for popular Linux distributions.

TIP: The benefit of using a Linux package manager to install the gem is that it handles installing Ruby and the RubyGems library if those packages are not already installed on your machine.
The drawback is that the package may not be available immediately after the release of the gem.
If you need the latest version, you can always fallback to using the `gem` command.

=== (a) gem install

Open a terminal and type: (without the leading `$`)

 $ gem install asciidoctor

If you want to install a pre-release version (e.g., a release candidate), use:

 $ gem install asciidoctor --pre

.Upgrading your installation
[TIP]
====
If you have an earlier version of Asciidoctor installed, you can update it using:

 $ gem upgrade asciidoctor

If you install a new version of the gem using `gem install` instead of gem update, you'll have multiple versions installed.
If that's the case, use the following gem command to remove the old versions:

 $ gem cleanup asciidoctor
====

=== (b) Bundler

. Create a Gemfile in the root folder of your project (or the current directory)
. Add the `asciidoctor` gem to your Gemfile as follows:
+
[source]
----
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'asciidoctor'
# or specify the version explicitly
# gem 'asciidoctor', '1.5.0'
----

. Save the Gemfile
. Open a terminal and install the gem using:

 $ bundle

To upgrade the gem, specify the new version in the Gemfile and run `bundle` again.
Using `bundle update` is not recommended as it will also update other gems, which may not be the desired result.

=== (c) Linux package managers

==== Yum (Fedora 18 or greater)

To install the gem on Fedora 18 or greater using yum, open a terminal and type:

 $ sudo yum install -y rubygem-asciidoctor

To upgrade the gem, use:

 $ sudo yum update -y rubygem-asciidoctor

TIP: Your Fedora system may be configured to automatically update packages, in which case no action is required by you to update the gem.

==== apt-get (Debian Sid, Ubuntu Saucy or greater)

To install the gem on Debian or Ubuntu, open a terminal and type:

 $ sudo apt-get install -y asciidoctor

To upgrade the gem, use:

 $ sudo apt-get upgrade -y asciidoctor

TIP: Your Debian or Ubuntu system may be configured to automatically update packages, in which case no action is required by you to update the gem.

=== Other installation options

* {uri-install-doc}[Installing the Asciidoctor toolchain]
* {uri-install-osx-doc}[Installing Asciidoctor on Mac OS X]

== Usage

If the Asciidoctor gem installed successfully, the `asciidoctor` command line interface (CLI) will be available on your PATH.
To verify it's available, run the following in your terminal:

 $ asciidoctor --version

You should see information about the Asciidoctor version and your Ruby environment printed in the terminal.

[.output]
....
Asciidoctor 1.5.0 [http://asciidoctor.org]
Runtime Environment (ruby 2.1.2p95 (2014-05-08 revision 45877) [x86_64-linux])
....

Asciidoctor also provides an API.
The API is intended for integration with other Ruby software, such as Rails, Sinatra and GitHub, and other languages, such as Java (via {uri-asciidoctorj}[AsciidoctorJ]) and JavaScript (via {uri-asciidoctorjs}[Asciidoctor.js]).

=== Command line interface (CLI)

The `asciidoctor` command allows you to invoke Asciidoctor from the command line (i.e., a terminal).

The following command converts the file README.adoc to HTML and saves the result to the file README.html in the same directory.
The name of the generated HTML file is derived from the source file by changing its file extension to `.html`.

 $ asciidoctor README.adoc

You can control the Asciidoctor processor by adding various flags and switches, which you can learn about using:

 $ asciidoctor --help

For instance, to write the file to a different directory, use:

 $ asciidoctor -D output README.adoc

The `asciidoctor` {uri-manpage}[man page] provides a complete reference of the command line interface.

Refer to the following resources to learn more about how to use the `asciidoctor` command.

* {uri-render-doc}[How do I convert a document?]
* {uri-themes-doc}[How do I use the Asciidoctor stylesheet factory to produce custom themes?]

=== Ruby API

To use Asciidoctor in your application, you first need to require the gem:

[source]
require 'asciidoctor'

You can then convert an AsciiDoc source file to an HTML file using:

[source]
Asciidoctor.convert_file 'README.adoc', to_file: true, safe: 'safe'

WARNING: When using Asciidoctor via the API, the default safe mode is `:secure`.
In secure mode, several core features are disabled, including the `include` directive.
If you want to enable these features, you'll need to explicitly set the safe mode to `server` (recommended) or `safe`.

You can also convert an AsciiDoc string to embeddable HTML (for inserting in an HTML page) using:

[source]
----
content = '_Zen_ in the art of writing http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc].'
Asciidoctor.convert content, safe: 'safe'
----

If you want the full HTML document, enable the `header_footer` option as follows:

[source]
----
content = '_Zen_ in the art of writing http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc].'
html = Asciidoctor.convert content, header_footer: true, safe: 'safe'
----

If you need access to the parsed document, you can split the conversion into discrete steps:

[source]
----
content = '_Zen_ in the art of writing http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc].'
document = Asciidoctor.load content, header_footer: true, safe: 'safe'
puts document.doctitle
html = document.convert
----

Keep in mind, if you don't like the output Asciidoctor produces, _you can change it!_
Asciidoctor supports custom {uri-tilt}[Tilt]-supported templates, which to allow you customize the output piecemeal, or custom converters, which give you 100% control over the output.

For more information about how to use the API or to customize the output, see the {uri-user-manual}[user manual].
